            (app2)
            (app3)

    Examaple :

    projects

            google_search app (module), 
            google_maps app (module), 
            google_images app (module)

            Admin_Area

    stop here for commit 

    # in challenges we have migration folder (empty = only __init__.py)

    challenges
        migrations
            __init__.py
        admin.py - building adminstration area
        apps.py - not important for the moment - actualy configures the challenge app
        models.py - important when we work with DB
        tests.py - important when we want to test
        views.py - important ! will start in next course section

        [   Because that is where we actually will write some logic
        for determining what we want to show to the users
        to the visitors on our website. 
        
        This is a super important file,
        and we are going to dive into this file
        and how to wire up this challenges app with our project,]
