# starting local development server

    directory challenges appears under mypage, with a lot of subdirectories, actually is an app or module

    projects
        mypage - django project
            challenges - individual app (app1), apps are the building blocks of the overall project -> app ~ module
            (app2)
            (app3)
            mypage - settings.py - contains the project configuration

    Examaple :

    projects 
        google (with apps): 
            google_search app (module), 
            google_maps app (module), 
            google_images app (module)
        amazon :
            amazon_video (prime)
            amazon_shop
            amazon_music

        my_online_shop:
            Products
            Cart
            Admin_Area

    stop here for commit 

    # in challenges we have migration folder (empty = only __init__.py)

    challenges
        migrations
            __init__.py
        admin.py - building adminstration area
        apps.py - not important for the moment - actualy configures the challenge app
        models.py - important when we work with DB
        tests.py - important when we want to test
        views.py - important ! will start in next course section

        [   Because that is where we actually will write some logic
        for determining what we want to show to the users
        to the visitors on our website. 
        
        This is a super important file,
        and we are going to dive into this file
        and how to wire up this challenges app with our project,]

    $ django-admin startproject monthly_challenges
    $ cd monthly_challenges
    $ python manage.py startapp challenges
    

        created new project monthly_challenges with the app challenges

        project: monthly_challenges
            challenges - app (module)

    stop here .

    what are URLs (routes) and Views ?

    a. URLs - routes

    google.com -  this is the root level URL
    academind/courses/ - this is a general behaviour for any site in the web
    in building a site we need to plan whic URL we want to support
    example :
    
    main url -  mypage.com/ - shows starting page
                mypage.com/posts - shows a list of all posts
                mypage.com/posts/python-is-great - shows a specific post

    URL is also mapping certain actions, things that should happen in a specific URL

    b. Views - are actualy those actions !!!
        the logic (python code that should be executed for different URLs)(and HTTP methods)
        the simplest representation of a view is just a function or a (class)
        that is executed when a request for a certain URL reaches the Django Server.
        (code that evaluates and handles requests and return responses)
(Load and prepare data ; Run a logic ; prepare and return response data etc.)

# run the server
$ python manage.py runserver

# we want to see localhost:8000/challenges/january
# we go into the challenges folder / views.py and create new views .i.e create a function

user -------> Request  ------->Server(remote machine)
user <------- Response ------- Server(remote machine)
                                        ^
                                        |
                                    DataBase

            View are responsable to :
            ----> process *request*

            (parsing the URL, HTTP methods and potentially request data) and 

            <-----create a *response*


# def index(request):
    return  HttpResponse("This Works") # (something : response to send back to the client) - param request - HttpResponse - 
                                       # need to import:  from django.http import HttpResponse
                                       # as an argument a respond data that can be a html page or a string

# but nothing happens , django doesn't know when to call it ...
# we save the views.py and create a new file inside the challenges folder called **urls.py**

# here :

# create a list called urlpatterns
# in the list we will put all the URLs we want to support and the view function that should be triggered 
# when a request reaches that url

# we use path(), we need to import it

from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path("january",)

]


# we use path(), we need to import it - for that we need to import it from views.py
# from . import views
# first argument path (url*,function index)

# if a request reaches /january then execute the function index

# but this is not enought ---until now we created a URLconfig

# this is done only in the challenges module (app) of the monthly_challenges project

# we need to connect this app to the entire project

# we go into the monthly_challegies/urls.py

# there we have already urlpatterns list, and already a path ...admin

# add here in the list , but the url is not pointing to the app challenges only ...and I want to 

# load all the urls defined for challenges app

# we can do this with another function .. include..
# that we need to import it ..

# from django.urls import include
# path("challenges",include("challenges.urls"))

# don't forget to save all files

# stop here
